    "text": "QUESTION|TASK 4\nThink of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?\nI chose the name Jordan, in reference to Michael Jordan from the blockbuster film ‘Space Jam’. I chose this name because not only did the movie have an effect, but even more noticably were the effect of his accomplishments outside of hollywood. The name had very low popularity up unitl the 1980s, seeing its lowpoint of 22 uses in 1951. Michael Jordan became relevent soon after the name’s popularity rise, starting his freshman season on University of North Carolina’s basketball team. But, it wasn’t until Michael Jordan’s rookie year in the NBA, 1984, where the name skyrocketed. Going from a name usage count of 2745 in 1984, to 11043 uses by 1990. Coincedentally, this is also year Michael Jordan won his first NBA championship. The name drops slightly over the years, but we see it another increase again following the release of his hit movie ‘Space Jam’ in 1996. The name once again hits it’s a peak in 1998, when Michael Jordan completed his second three-peat championship run. This was the same year that he retired from the Chicago Bulls, and the name never saw the same popularity again.\n::: {#cell-Q4 chart .cell execution_count=6}\n\nplot example\n# Include and execute your code here\nchart = px.line(\n    df.query('name == \"Jordan\"'), \n    x =\"year\", \n    y =\"Total\", \n    color = 'name',\n    title = \"The Impact of Space Jam and Michael Jordan's fame on the name 'Jordan'\")\n\nchart.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x =[1982, 1984, 1991, 1996, 1998],\n    y = [2195, 2745, 10785, 10074, 10760], \n    mode = \"markers\", \n    text = [\"Jordan's freshman year at UNC\", \n    \"Jordan's rookie NBA season\",\n    \"Jordan wins his first NBA championship\",\n    \"The release of Space Jam\",\n    \"Jordan  wins second championship 3-peat, announces retirement\",\n    ]))\nchart.add_annotation(x = 1996, y = 10074,\n    text=\"The release of Space Jam\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1,\n    ax=10,  \n    ay=50,\n    )\nchart.add_annotation(x = 1950, y = 8000,\n    text=\"You may hover over the unmarkerd red dots to get more info \")\nchart.update_layout(\n    plot_bgcolor = 'white',\n    xaxis_title = 'Year',\n    yaxis_title = 'Total', \n    title_x = 0.5,\n    title_font = dict(size = 18))             \nchart.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n:::",
